# Dominator tree

## Which implementation to use

`shark.HeapDominatorTree` — exact Lengauer–Tarjan with the simple link-eval, on `main` since
PR #2870. `shark.ObjectDominators.buildDominatorTree` is a thin wrapper that also computes sizes.
`shark.ApproximateDominatorTree` is the on device BFS approximation and must not be used here.

Why exactness was worth it: the approximation updates dominators incrementally during BFS, so when a
cross edge is processed the parent's dominator may still be stale and is never revisited. Retained
sizes come out under-attributed. Minimal failing case — edges `root→a`, `root→d`, `a→b`, `a→c`,
`d→e`, `e→b`, `b→c`: `dom(c)` is `root`, but BFS says `a`, because `b→c` is processed while `dom(b)`
is still `a`.

## How the explorer uses it

`HeapTreemap` calls `HeapDominatorTree.buildFor` with `AndroidReferenceReaderFactory` and **no**
reference matchers, then `buildNodes` with `AndroidObjectSizeCalculator`. No matchers on purpose:
ignoring a reference would hide retained memory, which is the one thing this tool exists to show.

Two consequences of Shark's reference readers that surprise you when reading a treemap:

- **A `java.lang.String`'s char array is not a node of its own.** `FieldInstanceReferenceReader`
  skips the `value` field, and `ShallowSizeCalculator` adds the array's bytes to the string instead.
- Primitive wrapper arrays are folded into their array the same way.

## Cost

Measured on a 193 MB heap dump (~983 K reachable objects, 2.5 M edges): **~48 MB peak** while
building the predecessor lists, ~43 MB during Lengauer–Tarjan, ~13 MB once only the dominators and
the id mapping remain. Only the predecessor structure scales with edge count; every other array is
sized by node count.

That's affordable on a phone but comfortable on desktop, which is part of why the explorer is a
desktop app. For reference, the app sits at ~240 MB RSS with a 24 MB heap dump open.

## Remaining inefficiency

`buildNodes` materialises a `Map<Long, DominatorNode>` holding a boxed `List<Long>` of children per
node, which is 100+ MB for a 1 M-object heap. `HeapDominatorTree.immediateDominatorOf` is the
primitive path, but there's no primitive equivalent for retained sizes and children yet. Worth doing
when a heap dump gets big enough to hurt — `TreemapTree` already hides the difference from the UI.

`DominatorNode.retainedSize` was widened from `Int` to `Long` in PR #2871, because the root of the
tree retains the whole reachable heap and wrapped negative past 2 GB.
