/**
 * [AndroidReferenceMatchers] values add [ReferenceMatcher] instances to a global list via their
 * [add] method. A [ReferenceMatcher] is either a [IgnoredReferenceMatcher] or
 * a [LibraryLeakReferenceMatcher].
 *
 * [AndroidReferenceMatchers] is used to build the list of known references that cannot ever create
 * leaks (via [IgnoredReferenceMatcher]) as well as the list of known leaks in the Android Framework
 * andÂ in manufacturer specific Android implementations.
 *
 * This class is a work in progress. You can help by reporting leak traces that seem to be caused
 * by the Android SDK, here: https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/new
 *
 * We filter on SDK versions and Manufacturers because many of those leaks are specific to a given
 * manufacturer implementation, they usually share their builds across multiple models, and the
 * leaks eventually get fixed in newer versions.
 *
 * Most app developers should use [appDefaults]. However, you can also use a subset of
 * [AndroidReferenceMatchers] by creating an [EnumSet] that matches your needs and calling
 * [buildKnownReferences].
