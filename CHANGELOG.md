# Change Log

All changes in 1.4+ are [tracked here](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.4+is%3Apr).

## Version 1.4-beta2 *(2016-03-23)*

* Add reason for ignoring to analysis result [#365](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/365).
* Lower memory usage when parsing heap dumps on M [#223](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/223).
* Fix NPE in LeakCanaryInternals.isInServiceProcess() [#449](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/449).
* New ignored Android SDK leaks [#297](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/297),[#322](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/322).
* Use leakcanary-android-no-op in test builds [#143](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/143).
* Fixes to allow LeakCanary to work with ProGuard [#398](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/398).
* Optimize png assets [#406](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/406).
* Fix delete button not working on error views [#408](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/408).
* Add German translation [#437](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/437).

## Version 1.4-beta1 *(2016-01-08)*

* Switched to [HAHA 2.0.2](https://github.com/square/haha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-202-2015-07-20) with uses Perflib instead of MAT under the hood [#219](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/219). This fixes crashes and improves speed a lot.
* We can now parse Android M heap dumps [#267](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/267), although there are still memory issues (see [#223](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/223)).
* Excluded leaks are now reported as well and available in the display leak activity.
* Added ProGuard configuration for [#132](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/132).
* Many new ignored Android SDK leaks.
* Added excluded leaks to text report [#119](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/119).
* Added LeakCanary SHA to text report [#120](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/120).
* Added CanaryLog API to replace the logger: [#201](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/201).
* Renamed all resources to begin with `leak_canary_` instead of `__leak_canary`[#161](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/161)
* No crash when heap dump fails [#226](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/226).
* Add retained size to leak reports [#162](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/162).

### Public API changes

* AnalysisResult.failure is now a `Throwable` instead of an `Exception`. Main goal is to catch and correctly report OOMs while parsing.
* Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries.
* Renamed `ExcludedRefs` fields.
* Each `ExcludedRef` entry can now be ignored entirely or "kept only if no other path".
* Added support for ignoring all fields (static and non static) for a given class.

## Version 1.3.1 *(2015-05-16)*

* Heap dumps and analysis results are now saved on the sd card: [#21](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/21).
* `ExcludedRef` and `AndroidExcludedRefs` are customizable: [#12](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/12) [#73](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/73).
* 7 new ignored Android SDK leaks: [#1](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1) [#4](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/4) [#32](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/32) [#89](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/89) [#82](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/82) [#97](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/97).
* Fixed 3 crashes in LeakCanary: [#37](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/37) [#46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46) [#66](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/66).
* Fixed StrictMode thread policy violations: [#15](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/15).
* Updated `minSdkVersion` from `9` to `8`: [#57](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/57).
* Added LeakCanary version name to `LeakCanary.leakInfo()`: [#49](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49).
* `leakcanary-android-no-op` is lighter, it does not depend on `leakcanary-watcher` anymore, only 2 classes now: [#74](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/74).
* Adding field state details to the text leak trace.
* A Toast is displayed while the heap dump is in progress to warn that the UI will freeze: [#20](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49). You can customize the toast by providing your own layout named `__leak_canary_heap_dump_toast.xml` (e.g. you could make it an empty layout).
* If the analysis fails, the result and heap dump are kept so that it can be reported to LeakCanary: [#102](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/102).
* Update to HAHA 1.3 to fix a 2 crashes [#3](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/3) [46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46)

### Public API changes

* When upgrading from 1.3 to 1.3.1, previously saved heap dumps will not be readable any more, but they won't be removed from the app directory. You should probably uninstall your app.
* Added `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to `leakcanary-android` artifact.
* `LeakCanary.androidWatcher()` parameter types have changed (+ExcludedRefs).
* `LeakCanary.leakInfo()` parameter types have changed (+boolean)
* `ExcludedRef` is now serializable and immutable, instances can be created using `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` is available in `HeapDump`
* `AndroidExcludedRefs` is an enum, you can now pick the leaks you want to ignore in `AndroidExcludedRefs` by creating an `EnumSet` and calling `AndroidExcludedRefs.createBuilder()`.
* `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAppDefaults()` & `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAndroidDefaults()` return a `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` moved from `leakcanary-analyzer` to `leakcanary-watcher`
