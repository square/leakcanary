# Change Log

## Future release

* [#1153](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1153) `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess` now correctly returns true in the analyzer process prior to any first leak (could be triggered by starting the leak result activity).


## Version 1.6.2 (2018-10-16)

* [#1067](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1067) Fixed TransactionTooLargeException crash (leak analysis would never complete).
* [#1061](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1061) Detection of Fragment view leaks after Fragment#onDestroyView().
* [#1076](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1076) Added the FOREGROUND_SERVICE permission for Android P.
* [#1062](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1062) The LeakCanary toast now always shows correctly. It doesn't show if there is no activity in foreground.
* [#1115](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1115) Reenabled the DisplayLeakActivity icon on fresh installs.
* [#1100](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1100) Added nullability annotations to improve Kotlin support.
* Updates to excluded leaks ([commits](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/commits/v1.6.2/leakcanary-android/src/main/java/com/squareup/leakcanary/AndroidExcludedRefs.java)).
* Updates to reachability inspectors ([commits](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/commits/v1.6.2/leakcanary-android/src/main/java/com/squareup/leakcanary/AndroidReachabilityInspectors.java)).

### Public API changes

* Subclasses of `AbstractAnalysisResultService` should now override `onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull AnalyzedHeap analyzedHeap)` instead of `onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull HeapDump heapDump, @NonNull AnalysisResult result)`

For more details, see the [1.6.2 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/4) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2).

## Version 1.6.1 (2018-06-21)

* [#727](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/727) Improved leak analysis: LeakCanary now identifies and highlights the potential causes of the leak.
* [#1011](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1011) We noticed that computing the retained heap size could take a long time, so it's now optional and off by default.
* [#633](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/633) Support for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests ([see the wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Customizing-LeakCanary#running-leakcanary-in-instrumentation-tests)).
* [#985](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/985) Ability to convert leak traces into stack traces for easy remote reporting ([see the wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Customizing-LeakCanary#uploading-to-a-server)).
* [#983](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/983) Support for watching destroyed Fragments.
* [#846](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/846) LeakCanary now uses foreground services and displays a notification when the analysis is in progress. This also fixes crashes when analyzing in background on O+.
* The LeakCanary icon (to start to DisplayLeakActivity) is now hidden by default, and only enabled after the first leak is found.
* [#775](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/775) Fixed crash when sharing heap dumps on O+ and added a dependency to the support-core-utils library.
* [#930](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/930) DisplayLeakActivity has a responsive icon.
* [#685](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/685) Stopped doing IO on main thread in DisplayLeakActivity (fixes StrictMode errors).
* [#999](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/999) Updated HAHA to 2.0.4, which uses Trove4j as an external dependency (from jcenter) instead of rebundling it. This is to clarify licences (Apache v2 vs LGPL 2.1).
* Several bug and crash fixes.

Note: we made a 1.6 release but quickly followed up with 1.6.1 due to [#1058](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1058).

### Public API changes

* The installed ref watcher singleton is now available via `LeakCanary.installedRefWatcher()`
* `AnalysisResult.leakTraceAsFakeException()` returns an exception that can be used to report and group leak traces to a tool like Bugsnag or Crashlytics.
* New `InstrumentationLeakDetector` and `FailTestOnLeakRunListener` APIs for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests.
* New `Reachability.Inspector` and `RefWatcherBuilder.stethoscopeClasses()` API to establish reachability and help identify leak causes.
* Watching activities can be disabled with `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchActivities(false)`, watching fragments can be disabled with `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchFragments(false)`
* `LeakCanary.setDisplayLeakActivityDirectoryProvider()` is deprecated and replaced with `LeakCanary.setLeakDirectoryProvider()`
* New `RefWatcherBuilder.computeRetainedHeapSize()` API to enable the computing of the retained heap size (off by default).

For more details, see the [1.6.1 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/3) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.5.4...v1.6.1).

  * No more cleanup on startup, we rotate the heap dump files on every new heap dump.
  * LeakCanary now falls back to the app directory until it can write to the external storage.
* Leak notifications now each use a distinct notification instead of erasing each other.
* If LeakCanary can't perform a heap dump for any reason (e.g. analysis in progress, debugger attached), it retries later with an exponential backoff.
* Added confirmation dialog when user deletes all leaks.
* Replace the two LeakCanary configuration methods with a builder that provides more flexibility, see `LeakCanary.refWatcher()`.

For more details, see the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.4...v1.5).

### Public API changes

* New `HeapAnalyzer.findTrackedReferences()` method for headless analysis when you have no context on what leaked.
* Added `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess()` to the no-op jar
* Added `LeakCanary.refWatcher()` which returns an `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder` that extends `RefWatcherBuilder` and lets you fully customize the `RefWatcher` instance.

* Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries.
* Renamed `ExcludedRefs` fields.
* Each `ExcludedRef` entry can now be ignored entirely or "kept only if no other path".

## Version 1.3.1 *(2015-05-16)*

* Heap dumps and analysis results are now saved on the sd card: [#21](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/21).
* `ExcludedRef` and `AndroidExcludedRefs` are customizable: [#12](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/12) [#73](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/73).
* 7 new ignored Android SDK leaks: [#1](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1) [#4](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/4) [#32](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/32) [#89](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/89) [#82](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/82) [#97](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/97).

* Fixed StrictMode thread policy violations: [#15](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/15).
* Updated `minSdkVersion` from `9` to `8`: [#57](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/57).
* Added LeakCanary version name to `LeakCanary.leakInfo()`: [#49](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49).
* `leakcanary-android-no-op` is lighter, it does not depend on `leakcanary-watcher` anymore, only 2 classes now: [#74](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/74).
* Adding field state details to the text leak trace.
* A Toast is displayed while the heap dump is in progress to warn that the UI will freeze: [#20](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49). You can customize the toast by providing your own layout named `__leak_canary_heap_dump_toast.xml` (e.g. you could make it an empty layout).
* If the analysis fails, the result and heap dump are kept so that it can be reported to LeakCanary: [#102](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/102).
* Update to HAHA 1.3 to fix a 2 crashes [#3](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/3) [46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46)

### Public API changes

* When upgrading from 1.3 to 1.3.1, previously saved heap dumps will not be readable any more, but they won't be removed from the app directory. You should probably uninstall your app.
* Added `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to `leakcanary-android` artifact.
* `LeakCanary.androidWatcher()` parameter types have changed (+ExcludedRefs).
* `LeakCanary.leakInfo()` parameter types have changed (+boolean)
* `ExcludedRef` is now serializable and immutable, instances can be created using `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` is available in `HeapDump`
* `AndroidExcludedRefs` is an enum, you can now pick the leaks you want to ignore in `AndroidExcludedRefs` by creating an `EnumSet` and calling `AndroidExcludedRefs.createBuilder()`.
* `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAppDefaults()` & `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAndroidDefaults()` return a `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` moved from `leakcanary-analyzer` to `leakcanary-watcher`

## Version 1.3 *(2015-05-08)*

Initial release.
