/**
 * [InstrumentationLeakDetector] can be used to detect memory leaks in instrumentation tests.
 *
 * To use it, you need to add an instrumentation test listener (e.g. [FailTestOnLeakRunListener])
 * that will invoke [detectLeaks].
 *
 * ### Add an instrumentation test listener
 *
 * LeakCanary provides [FailTestOnLeakRunListener], but you can also implement
 * your own [RunListener] and call [detectLeaks] directly if you need a more custom
 * behavior (for instance running it only once per test suite).
 *
 * All you need to do is add the following to the defaultConfig of your build.gradle:
 *
 * `testInstrumentationRunnerArgument "listener", "leakcanary.FailTestOnLeakRunListener"`
 *
 * Then you can run your instrumentation tests via Gradle as usually, and they will fail when
 * a memory leak is detected:
 *
 * `./gradlew leakcanary-sample:connectedCheck`
 *
 * If instead you want to run UI tests via adb, add a *listener* execution argument to
 * your command line for running the UI tests:
 * `-e listener leakcanary.FailTestOnLeakRunListener`. The full command line
 * should look something like this:
 * ```
 * adb shell am instrument \\
 * -w com.android.foo/android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner \\
 * -e listener leakcanary.FailTestOnLeakRunListener
 * ```
 *
 * ### Rationale
 * Instead of using the [InstrumentationLeakDetector], one could simply enable LeakCanary in
 * instrumentation tests.
 *
 * This approach would have two disadvantages:
 *
 *  - Heap dumps freeze the VM, and the leak analysis is IO and CPU heavy. This can slow down
 * the test and introduce flakiness
 *  - The leak analysis is asynchronous by default. This means the tests could finish and the
 *  process dies before the analysis is finished.
 *
 * The approach taken here is to collect all objects to watch as you run the test, but not
 * do any heap dump during the test. Then, at the end, if any of the watched objects is still in
 * memory we dump the heap and perform a blocking analysis. There is only one heap dump performed,
 * no matter the number of objects retained.
