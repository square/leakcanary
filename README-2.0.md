# LeakCanary

A memory leak detection library for Android and Kotlin.

*“A small leak will sink a great ship.”* - Benjamin Franklin

## Getting started

Add LeakCanary to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.0-alpha-1'
}
```

**You're good to go!** LeakCanary will automatically show a notification when an activity or fragment memory leak is detected in your debug build.

## Recipes

### Watching custom objects

```kotlin
class MyService : Service {

  // ...

  override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    LeakSentry.refWatcher.watch(this)
  }

}
```

### Configuring LeakSentry & LeakCanary

LeakSentry is in charge of detecting memory leaks. Its configuration can be updated at any time by replacing `LeakSentry.config`:
```kotlin
class DebugExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    LeakSentry.config = LeakSentry.config.copy(watchFragmentViews = false)
  }
}
```

// LeakCanary is in charge of taking heap dumps and analyzing them. Its configuration can be updated at any time by replacing `LeakCanary.config`:

```
disableLeakCanaryButton.setOnClickListener {
  LeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.copy(dumpHeap = false)
}
```

### Counting retained instances in production

In your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-sentry:2.0-alpha-1'
}
```

In your leak reporting code:
```kotlin
val retainedInstanceCount = LeakSentry.refWatcher.retainedKeys.size
```

### Alternate setup with the old perflib heap parser

If you want to try LeakCanary 2.0 features with the battle tested perflib heap parser:

```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-perflib:2.0-alpha-1'
}
```

In your **debug** `Application` class:

```kotlin
class DebugExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    if (LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess(this)) {
      // This process is dedicated to Perflib for heap analysis.
      // You should not init your app in this process.
      return
    }
    super.onCreate()
  }
}
```
