*“A small leak will sink a great ship.”* - Benjamin Franklin

## Getting started

In your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
 dependencies {
   debugCompile 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:1.4'
   releaseCompile 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-no-op:1.4'
   testCompile 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-no-op:1.4'
 }
```

In your `Application` class:

```java
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

  @Override public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    if (LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess(this)) {
      // This process is dedicated to LeakCanary for heap analysis.
      // You should not init your app in this process.
      return;
    }
    LeakCanary.install(this);
    // Normal app init code...
  }
}
```

Also, if you want to inject LeakCanary into your own project, you can build this project and add libs to your project, then:
```java
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

  @Override public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    LeakCanary.installResourceProvider(new IResourceProvider() {
        // blah blah
    });
	LeakCanary.install(this, XDisplayLeakService.class, AndroidExcludedRefs.createAppDefaults().build());
  }
  private static class XDisplayLeakService extends DisplayLeakService {
      // empty class is OK.
  }
}
```

**You're good to go!** LeakCanary will automatically show a notification when an activity memory leak is detected in your debug build.
