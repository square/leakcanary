### All Types

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [shark.CloseableHeapGraph](../shark/-closeable-heap-graph.md) | A [HeapGraph](../shark/-heap-graph/index.md) that should be closed after being used. |
| [shark.GraphContext](../shark/-graph-context/index.md) | In memory store that can be used to store objects in a given [HeapGraph](../shark/-heap-graph/index.md) instance. This is a simple [MutableMap](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-mutable-map/index.html) of [String](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html) to [Any](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-any/index.html), but with unsafe generics access. |
| [shark.HeapField](../shark/-heap-field/index.md) | Represents a static field or an instance field. |
| [shark.HeapGraph](../shark/-heap-graph/index.md) | Enables navigation through the heap graph of objects. |
| [shark.HeapObject](../shark/-heap-object/index.md) | An object in the heap dump. |
| [shark.HeapValue](../shark/-heap-value/index.md) | Represents a value in the heap dump, which can be an object reference or a primitive type. |
| [shark.HprofHeapGraph](../shark/-hprof-heap-graph/index.md) | A [HeapGraph](../shark/-heap-graph/index.md) that reads from an Hprof file indexed by [HprofIndex](../shark/-hprof-index/index.md). |
| [shark.HprofIndex](../shark/-hprof-index/index.md) | An index on a Hprof file. See [openHeapGraph](../shark/-hprof-index/open-heap-graph.md). |
