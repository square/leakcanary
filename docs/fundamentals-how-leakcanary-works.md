## Detecting retained objects

The foundation of LeakCanary is the `leakcanary-object-watcher-android` library. It hooks into the Android lifecycle to automatically detect when activities and fragments are destroyed and should be garbage collected. These destroyed objects are passed to an `ObjectWatcher`, which holds **weak references** to them. You can watch any objects that is no longer needed, for example a detached view, a destroyed presenter, etc.

```kotlin
AppWatcher.objectWatcher.watch(myDetachedView, "View was detached")
```

If the weak references aren't cleared after **waiting 5 seconds** and running garbage collection, the watched objects are considered **retained**, and potentially leaking. LeakCanary logs this to Logcat:

```
D LeakCanary: Watching instance of com.example.leakcanary.MainActivity
  (Activity received Activity#onDestroy() callback) 

... 5 seconds later ...

D LeakCanary: Scheduling check for retained objects because found new object
  retained
```

LeakCanary waits for the count of retained objects to reach a threshold before dumping the heap, and displays a notification with the latest count.

```
D LeakCanary: Rescheduling check for retained objects in 2000ms because found
  only 4 retained objects (< 5 while app visible)
```

!!! info
    The default threshold is **5 retained objects** when the app is **visible**, and **1 retained object** when the app is **not visible**. If you see the retained objects notification and then put the app in background (for example by pressing the Home button), then the threshold changes from 5 to 1 and LeakCanary dumps the heap within 5 seconds. Tapping the notification forces LeakCanary to dump the heap immediately.

## Dumping the heap

When the count of retained objects reaches a threshold, LeakCanary dumps the Java heap into a `.hprof` file stored onto the Android file system. This freezes the app for a short amount of time, during which LeakCanary displays the following toast:

## Analyzing the heap

LeakCanary parses the `.hprof` file using [Shark](shark.md) and locates the retained objects in that heap dump.

For each retained object, LeakCanary finds the path of references which prevents that retained object from being garbage collected: its **leak trace**. Leak trace is another name for the *best strong reference path from garbage collection roots to a retained object*.

When the analysis is done, LeakCanary displays a **notification** with a summary, and also prints the result in **Logcat**. Notice below how the **4 retained objects** are grouped as **2 distinct leaks**. LeakCanary creates a **signature for each leak trace**, and groups together leaks that have the same signature, ie leaks that are caused by the same bug.

Tapping the notification starts an activity that provides more details. Each row corresponds to a group of leaks with the same signature. LeakCanary will mark a leak as **New** if it's the first time you've seen a leak with that signature.

Tapping into a leak opens up a screen where you can see each retained object and its leak trace. You can toggle between retained objects via a drop down.

The leak signature is the hash of the concatenation of each **<span style="color: #9976a8;">reference</span>** suspected to cause the leak, ie each reference **<span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red; text-decoration-style: wavy; color: #9976a8;">displayed with a red underline</span>**:

![toast](images/signature.png)

These same suspicious references are underlined with `~~~` when the leak trace is shared as text:

```
...
│  
├─ com.example.leakcanary.LeakingSingleton class
│    Leaking: NO (a class is never leaking)
│    ↓ static LeakingSingleton.leakedViews
│                              ~~~~~~~~~~~
├─ java.util.ArrayList instance
│    Leaking: UNKNOWN
│    ↓ ArrayList.elementData
│                ~~~~~~~~~~~
├─ java.lang.Object[] array
│    Leaking: UNKNOWN
│    ↓ Object[].[0]
│               ~~~
├─ android.widget.TextView instance
│    Leaking: YES (View.mContext references a destroyed activity)
...
```

In the example above, the signature of the leak would be computed as:

```kotlin
val leakSignature = sha1Hash(
    "com.example.leakcanary.LeakingSingle.leakedView" +
    "java.util.ArrayList.elementData" +
    "java.lang.Object[].[x]"
)
println(leakSignature)
// d962211eda4d45ac50d88d8f212224116a664968
```
