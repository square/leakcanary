# Change Log

## Version 2.2 (2020-02-05)

We've got some good stuff for the first release of the decade!

### ViewModel leak detection

[Android ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) are really cool! Their lifecycle is much nicer than fragments or activities, but sometimes mistakes happen. LeakCanary will now automatically detect ViewModel leaks and report any ViewModel instance retained after its `onCleared()` method was called.

### Android TV

![tv ui](images/android-tv-leaks.png)

LeakCanary is finally coming to big screens near you! 

Best part - no additional setup is required, just enable it like you would for a [mobile device](getting_started.md). 

Now whenever there's a leak - you will see a helpful Toast appear with all the details.  

Make sure to check out our new [Android TV](recipes.md#android-tv) section and chill! 

### Java-friendly Config builders

[It was brought to our attention](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1714) that configuring `LeakCanary` and `AppWatcher` was a miserable experience from Java code. Well, not anymore!

Now you can use `LeakCanary.Config.Builder` and `AppWatcher.Config.Builder` to have idiomatic Java when updating the configurations. For example:

```
LeakCanary.Config config = LeakCanary.getConfig().newBuilder()
  .retainedVisibleThreshold(3)
  .computeRetainedHeapSize(false)
  .build();
LeakCanary.setConfig(config);
```

If you notice any other problems when using LeakCanary from Java, please [file an issue](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=3-feature.md&title=)! We take Java-interop seriously and will be happy to improve LeakCanary's API! 

For more details, see the [2.2 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/16) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.1...v2.2).

### A Gradle plugin for obfuscated apps

It's fairly common for teams to have a QA build that is tested before making the release build. Usually that build will be obfuscated (via Proguard or R8), but also add LeakCanary to detect leaks during QA. This leads to obfuscated leak traces, which are hard to understand ü§Ø. Check out our new [Gradle deobfuscation plugin](recipes.md#using-leakcanary-with-obfuscated-apps) and rejoice!

### UI <strike>twix</strike> tweaks

In 2.0 we changed the LeakCanary UI and UX, and built a foundation on which 2.1 extends.

![ui](images/screenshot-2.0.png)

* Since 2.0, Leaks are grouped by their distinct signature. In 2.1 there's a `New` tag that will show until you open up a leak. There's also a `Library Leak` tag for leaks that are known to be caused by a bug in the Android Framework or Google libraries, and the library leak description now shows up in the UI.
* The type of the Java objects (class, instance, array) is now displayed in the LeakTrace, e.g. see `FontsContract class` and `ExampleApplication instance` above.
* The type of the GC root now shows up at the root of the leak trace. Makes sense!
* The leak result notification has an importance now set to MAX so that it'll show up right in your face. If you turn it off, the canary will haunt you in your dreams üê§üëª. To save your sanity and your device battery, automatic heap dumps now won't happen more often than once per minute.
* The resource id name for `View` instances is now displayed in the leak trace. You shouldn't look at the [implementation](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1663).

```
‚îú‚îÄ android.widget.TextView instance
‚îÇ    View.mID = R.id.helper_text
```

### Documentation goodies

* The [Fundamentals](fundamentals.md) page was entirely rewritten, split into 3 pages and moved to its own tab. Please read it and provide feedback!
* At Square, we have been uploading leaks to Bugsnag for 3 years now, so that no leak ever gets missed. Follow [this recipe](recipes.md#uploading-to-bugsnag)!
* Did you know you can [run LeakCanary in a JVM](recipes.md#detecting-leaks-in-jvm-applications)?

### API <strike>breaking</strike> bettering changes

* The APIs of the `Leak` and `LeakTrace` classes have significantly changed, e.g. all `LeakTrace` instances with an identical signature are grouped under the same Leak object. Despite these breaking changes, this release version is a minor update. Oh noes, what about semantic versioning üò±? Ask Don Quixote.
* You can now customize the way LeakCanary finds the leaking objects in the heap dump. For example, here's the configuration SharkCli uses to find leaks in heap dumps of apps that don't even have the LeakCanary dependency:

```kotlin
LeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.copy(
    leakingObjectFinder = FilteringLeakingObjectFinder(
        AndroidObjectInspectors.appLeakingObjectFilters
    )
)
```

* LeakCanary automatically disables itself in tests by detecting that the `org.junit.Test` is in the classpath. Unfortunately, some apps ship Junit in their app debug classpath (e.g. when using OkHttp MockWebServer). You can now customize which class is used to detect tests:

```xml
<resources>
  <string name="leak_canary_test_class_name">assertk.Assert</string>
</resources>
```

### Interactive CLI

[Shark CLI](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/releases/download/v2.1/shark-cli-2.1.zip) was rewritten on top of [Clikt](https://github.com/ajalt/clikt):

```bash
$ shark-cli
Usage: shark-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

                 ^`.                 .=""=.
 ^_              \  \               / _  _ \
 \ \             {   \             |  d  b  |
 {  \           /     `~~~--__     \   /\   /
 {   \___----~~'              `~~-_/'-=\/=-'\,
  \                         /// a  `~.      \ \
  / /~~~~-, ,__.    ,      ///  __,,,,)      \ |
  \/      \/    `~~~;   ,---~~-_`/ \        / \/

                  '._.'             _|`~~`|_
                                    /|\  /|\

Options:
  -p, --process NAME              Full or partial name of a process, e.g.
                                  "example" would match "com.example.app"
  -d, --device ID                 device/emulator id
  -m, --obfuscation-mapping PATH  path to obfuscation mapping file
  --verbose / --no-verbose        provide additional details as to what
                                  shark-cli is doing
  -h, --hprof FILE                path to a .hprof file
  --help                          Show this message and exit

Commands:
  interactive   Explore a heap dump.
  analyze       Analyze a heap dump.
  dump-process  Dump the heap and pull the hprof file.
  strip-hprof   Replace all primitive arrays from the provided heap dump with
                arrays of zeroes and generate a new "-stripped.hprof" file.
```

There's a new `interactive` command which enables exploring the heap dump from the command line:

```bash
$ shark-cli -h heapdump.hprof interactive
Enter command [help]:
help

Available commands:
  analyze                   Analyze the heap dump.
  class NAME@ID             Show class with a matching NAME and Object ID.
  instance CLASS_NAME@ID    Show instance with a matching CLASS_NAME and Object
ID.
  array CLASS_NAME@ID       Show array instance with a matching CLASS_NAME and
Object ID.
  ->instance CLASS_NAME@ID  Show path from GC Roots to instance.
  ~>instance CLASS_NAME@ID  Show path from GC Roots to instance, highlighting
suspect references.
  help                      Show this message.
  exit                      Exit this interactive prompt.
```

We're currently exploring the idea of adding [support for SQL queries](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1211795647273160704), feedback welcome!

For more details, see the [2.1 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/15) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.0...v2.1).

## Version 2.0 (2019-11-27)

In the past 7 months, LeakCanary went through 3 alphas and 5 betas, encompassing 23 contributors over 493 commits, 35826 insertions and 10156 deletions.

### Should I upgrade?

**YES!** LeakCanary 2 is so much better, it might make you excited when you see a new memory leak. Follow the [upgrade guide](upgrading-to-leakcanary-2.0.md), you won't regret it!

### So, what's changed since 1.6.3?

**Everything.** The LeakCanary codebase went from **~6000** lines of Java to **~16000** lines of Kotlin, excluding comments & blanks.

!!! question "Isn't Kotlin supposed to drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate code?"
    Absolutely! And it did. But then, we wrote more code.
    LeakCanary used to depend on [HAHA](https://github.com/square/haha), a repackaging of [perflib](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/2f03004c181baf9d291a9bf992e1b444e83cd82d/perflib/), the heap dump parser used by Android Studio. Unfortunately perflib was slow and used too much memory, so LeakCanary now includes its own heap dump parser: [Shark](shark.md). The extra code comes from Shark, but also from having a lot more automated tests, and an improved UI layer.

One major difference: when the app is in foreground, LeakCanary 2 will not trigger on every retained instance. Instead it will wait until the app goes in background or to reach a threashold of 5 retained instances in foreground. The analysis will then find all the leaks at once, and group identical leaks in the results UI. Please read the [Fundamentals](fundamentals.md) section to learn more!

### Random facts

* You can customize the Leaks launcher icon and label: [learn more here](recipes.md#icon-and-label).
* If you ` press on your main activity launcher icon, you should see a LeakCanary dynamic shortcut. You can then long press that to drop it on your home screen, and the launcher shows that it's the leaks launcher for your app.
* Out of the box, LeakCanary tracks all fragments flavors: AOSP, Support Library and Android X.
* From within the leak screen, you can share a leak to stack overflow. You can also share a heap dump, or import and analyze a heap dump from another device.
* You can run LeakCanary from your computer command line, on any debuggable app even if that app doesn't have LeakCanary: [learn more here](shark.md##shark-cli).
* The new documentation is fully searchable and includes the API documentation. Try the search bar ‚§¥.
* A large 160Mb heap dump uses 2Gb memory when opening it in Android Studio, but only 40Mb with Shark.

## Version 2.0 Beta 1 (2019-07-30)

* New standalone library! [Shark](shark.md) is the heap analyzer that powers LeakCanary 2, and it can run in any Java VM. It comes with a [CLI](shark.md#shark-cli): you can now run `shark-cli analyze-process com.example.myapp` from your computer.
* New Heap Explorer directly on device! Open a Heap Analysis in LeakCanary, tap the options menu and select "Heap Explorer". This is still experimental and not very user friendly, contributions welcome!
* **Large API rewrite** to improve usability. If you used the alpha with a customized configuration, there are breaking changes. Of note: LeakSentry became [AppWatcher](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-object-watcher-android/leakcanary/-app-watcher/), RefWatcher became [ObjectWatcher](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-object-watcher/leakcanary/-object-watcher/), AndroidExcludedRefs became [AndroidReferenceMatchers](/leakcanary/api/shark-android/shark/-android-reference-matchers/), AnalysisResultListener became [OnHeapAnalyzedListener](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-android-core/leakcanary/-on-heap-analyzed-listener/), AndroidLeakTraceInspectors became [AndroidObjectInspectors](/leakcanary/api/shark-android/shark/-android-object-inspectors/).
* The entire API surface is now documented and the documentation is available on this website: see the **LeakCanary API** tab at the top.
* Removed the **dependency on Android X**. No more configuration issues! [#1462](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1462) 
* Added **Proguard rules** for LeakCanary and ObjectWatcher. [#1500](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1500) 
* Display LeakCanary version in the About screen. [#1448](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1448) 
* Bug fixes, new reference matchers and object inspectors

## Version 2.0 Alpha 1 (2019-04-23)

![logo](images/logo-2.0-200px.png)

* New [logo](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/FAQ#who-made-the-logo), thanks [@flickator](https://github.com/flickator)!
* Entirely rewritten to **100% Kotlin**
* Multiple leaks detected in one analysis
    * The heap is dumped when the app goes in the background, or when a minimum of 5 leaks is reached in the foreground.
* Leak grouping
    * Leaks that share similar causes are grouped in the UI.
    * New screens to see the list of groups and each group.
    * Improved leaktrace strings to highlight leak causes.
    * Leaks can be shared to Stack Overflow
* New library: **LeakSentry**.
    * Detects when objects are leaking and triggers LeakCanary
    * Can be used independently in production, for instance to report the number of leaking instances on an OutOfMemoryError crash.
* New heap parser
    * Uses **90% less memory and 6 times** faster than the prior heap parser.
    * Runs in the same process as the app on a low priority thread.
    * No more dependency on Perflib and TroveJ. New dependency on Okio.
    * The old parser is still available as `leakcanary-android-perflib` but will be removed after alpha.
* Labelers can add any string content to leak elements
* 0 code setup, just add the one debug dependency.
* Simpler configuration options
* Updated from support library to Android X

* [#1153](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1153) `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess` now correctly returns true in the analyzer process prior to any first leak (could be triggered by starting the leak result activity).
* [#1158](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1158) Stopped enabling DisplayLeakActivity when not using DisplayLeakService.
* [#1135](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1135) Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException for leak traces of size 1.

### Public API changes

* Subclasses of `AbstractAnalysisResultService` should now override `onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull AnalyzedHeap analyzedHeap)` instead of `onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull HeapDump heapDump, @NonNull AnalysisResult result)`

For more details, see the [1.6.2 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/4) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2).

## Version 1.6.1 (2018-06-21)

* [#727](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/727) Improved leak analysis: LeakCanary now identifies and highlights the potential causes of the leak.
* [#1011](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1011) We noticed that computing the retained heap size could take a long time, so it's now optional and off by default.
* [#633](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/633) Support for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests ([see the wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Customizing-LeakCanary#running-leakcanary-in-instrumentation-tests)).
* [#985](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/985) Ability to convert leak traces into stack traces for easy remote reporting ([see the wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Customizing-LeakCanary#uploading-to-a-server)).
* [#983](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/983) Support for watching destroyed Fragments.
* [#846](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/846) LeakCanary now uses foreground services and displays a notification when the analysis is in progress. This also fixes crashes when analyzing in background on O+.
* The LeakCanary icon (to start to DisplayLeakActivity) is now hidden by default, and only enabled after the first leak is found.
* [#775](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/775) Fixed crash when sharing heap dumps on O+ and added a dependency to the support-core-utils library.
* [#930](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/930) DisplayLeakActivity has a responsive icon.
* [#685](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/685) Stopped doing IO on main thread in DisplayLeakActivity (fixes StrictMode errors).
* [#999](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/999) Updated HAHA to 2.0.4, which uses Trove4j as an external dependency (from jcenter) instead of rebundling it. This is to clarify licences (Apache v2 vs LGPL 2.1).
* Several bug and crash fixes.

 for the code contributions!

Note: we made a 1.6 release but quickly followed up with 1.6.1 due to [#1058](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1058).

### Public API changes

* The installed ref watcher singleton is now available via `LeakCanary.installedRefWatcher()`
* `AnalysisResult.leakTraceAsFakeException()` returns an exception that can be used to report and group leak traces to a tool like Bugsnag or Crashlytics.
* New `InstrumentationLeakDetector` and `FailTestOnLeakRunListener` APIs for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests.
* New `Reachability.Inspector` and `RefWatcherBuilder.stethoscopeClasses()` API to establish reachability and help identify leak causes.
* Watching activities can be disabled with `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchActivities(false)`, watching fragments can be disabled with `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchFragments(false)`
* `LeakCanary.setDisplayLeakActivityDirectoryProvider()` is deprecated and replaced with `LeakCanary.setLeakDirectoryProvider()`
* New `RefWatcherBuilder.computeRetainedHeapSize()` API to enable the computing of the retained heap size (off by default).

For more details, see the [1.6.1 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/3) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.5.4...v1.6.1).

    * No more cleanup on startup, we rotate the heap dump files on every new heap dump.
    * LeakCanary now falls back to the app directory until it can write to the external storage.
* Leak notifications now each use a distinct notification instead of erasing each other.
* If LeakCanary can't perform a heap dump for any reason (e.g. analysis in progress, debugger attached), it retries later with an exponential backoff.
* Added confirmation dialog when user deletes all leaks.
* Replace the two LeakCanary configuration methods with a builder that provides more flexibility, see `LeakCanary.refWatcher()`.

For more details, see the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.4...v1.5).

### Public API changes

* New `HeapAnalyzer.findTrackedReferences()` method for headless analysis when you have no context on what leaked.
* Added `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess()` to the no-op jar
* Added `LeakCanary.refWatcher()` which returns an `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder` that extends `RefWatcherBuilder` and lets you fully customize the `RefWatcher` instance.

* Add retained size to leak reports [#162](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/162).

### Public API changes

* AnalysisResult.failure is now a `Throwable` instead of an `Exception`. Main goal is to catch and correctly report OOMs while parsing.
* Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries.
* Renamed `ExcludedRefs` fields.
* Each `ExcludedRef` entry can now be ignored entirely or "kept only if no other path".

## Version 1.3.1 *(2015-05-16)*

* Heap dumps and analysis results are now saved on the sd card: [#21](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/21).
* `ExcludedRef` and `AndroidExcludedRefs` are customizable: [#12](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/12) [#73](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/73).
* 7 new ignored Android SDK leaks: [#1](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1) [#4](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/4) [#32](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/32) [#89](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/89) [#82](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/82) [#97](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/97).
* Fixed 3 crashes in LeakCanary: [#37](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/37) [#46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46) [#66](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/66).
* Fixed StrictMode thread policy violations: [#15](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/15).
* Updated `minSdkVersion` from `9` to `8`: [#57](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/57).
* Added LeakCanary version name to `LeakCanary.leakInfo()`: [#49](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49).
* `leakcanary-android-no-op` is lighter, it does not depend on `leakcanary-watcher` anymore, only 2 classes now: [#74](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/74).
* Adding field state details to the text leak trace.
* A Toast is displayed while the heap dump is in progress to warn that the UI will freeze: [#20](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49). You can customize the toast by providing your own layout named `__leak_canary_heap_dump_toast.xml` (e.g. you could make it an empty layout).
* If the analysis fails, the result and heap dump are kept so that it can be reported to LeakCanary: [#102](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/102).
* Update to HAHA 1.3 to fix a 2 crashes [#3](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/3) [46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46)

### Public API changes

* When upgrading from 1.3 to 1.3.1, previously saved heap dumps will not be readable any more, but they won't be removed from the app directory. You should probably uninstall your app.
* Added `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to `leakcanary-android` artifact.
* `LeakCanary.androidWatcher()` parameter types have changed (+ExcludedRefs).
* `LeakCanary.leakInfo()` parameter types have changed (+boolean)
* `ExcludedRef` is now serializable and immutable, instances can be created using `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` is available in `HeapDump`
* `AndroidExcludedRefs` is an enum, you can now pick the leaks you want to ignore in `AndroidExcludedRefs` by creating an `EnumSet` and calling `AndroidExcludedRefs.createBuilder()`.
* `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAppDefaults()` & `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAndroidDefaults()` return a `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` moved from `leakcanary-analyzer` to `leakcanary-watcher`

## Version 1.3 *(2015-05-08)*

Initial release.
