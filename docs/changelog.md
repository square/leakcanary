* 💥 [#2268](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/2268) WorkManager expedited request crashes before API 31.
* 💥 [#2270](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2270) Updating `LeakCanary.config` crashes when `AppWatcher` is not installed.
* 💥 [#2271](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2271) Analysis failure on API 25 because `HashMap$Entry` became `HashMap$HashMapEntry` (on API 25) before it finally changed to `HashMap$Node`.

For more details, see the [2.8.1 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/24) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.8...v2.8.1).

## Version 2.8 (2022-01-04)

Note: please update to `2.8.1` instead.

### Preface

The last release was 9 months ago. What happened?! Well, soon after releasing LeakCanary 2.7, I had my 2nd baby, a wonderful daughter 😍. Having 2 young kids leaves a lot less time available for Open Source work... but it's worth it!

### Improved support for data structure internals

🤓 Inspired [by Android Studio](https://twitter.com/RalucaSauciuc/status/1343800565352996871), LeakCanary's node discovery during heap graph traversal is now abstracted away. This allows overlaying logical structure over common data structure internals.

😅 WHAT?!

👉 This means we can make known data structures look more like their APIs than their internals. For example, developers tend to think of setting a `HashMap` entry as `map["key"] = value` rather than `map.table[hash("key")].next.next.next = Node(value)`, which is what LeakCanary would previously show in its leak traces.

Let's look at a `HashMap` example:

```kotlin
class CheckoutController {

  val tabs = HashMap<String, Tab>()

  fun addItemsTab(tab: Tab) {
    tabs["ItemsTab"] = tab
  }
}
```

If the `Tab` instance holds on to a view, we might see a leak trace that would look like this:

```
│ ...
├─ com.example.CheckoutController instance
│    ↓ CheckoutController.tabs
├─ java.util.HashMap instance
│    ↓ HashMap.table
├─ java.util.HashMap$Node[] array
│    ↓ HashMap$Node[42]
├─ java.util.HashMap$Node instance
│    ↓ HashMap$Node.next
├─ java.util.HashMap$Node instance
│    ↓ HashMap$Node.value
├─ com.example.Tab instance
│ ...
```

With the improved data structure support, the leak trace is much clearer (also note how the `ItemsTab` string key is now surfaced):

```
│ ...
├─ com.example.CheckoutController instance
│    ↓ CheckoutController.tabs
├─ java.util.HashMap instance
│    ↓ HashMap[ItemsTab]
├─ com.example.Tab instance
│ ...
```

Another benefit of this change is that leak signatures become less dependent of the runtime, and therefore are more consistent. This is especially true for any data structure that relies on a linked list (`HashMap`, `LinkedList`, `MessageQueue`, ...). Currently LeakCanary supports a limited set of common data structures from Apache Harmony, Open JDK, and the Android SDK. Let me know what else you need!

### ObjectAnimator leaks

LeakCanary will now detect leaks that trigger when forgetting to cancel `ObjectAnimator`. This new feature is enabled by the node discovery changes described above!

Let's say you accidentally start an infinite `ObjectAnimator` and never cancel it, like so:

```kotlin
class ExampleActivity : Activity() {

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity)
    findViewById<Button>(R.id.button).setOnClickListener { view ->
      ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view, View.ALPHA, 0.1f, 0.2f).apply {
        duration = 100
        repeatMode = ValueAnimator.REVERSE
        repeatCount = ValueAnimator.INFINITE
        start()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In previous releases, LeakCanary would detect that the animated view is leaking but it wouldn't be able to find the leak and instead would report it as an unreachable object: _An unreachable object is still in memory but LeakCanary could not find a strong reference path from GC roots._

LeakCanary now reports the leak and adds animator state information, helping detect and fix any infinite `ObjectAnimator`.

```
┬───
│ GC Root: Thread object
│
├─ java.lang.Thread instance
│    Leaking: NO (the main thread always runs)
│    Thread name: 'main'
│    ↓ Thread.threadLocals
│             ~~~~~~~~~~~~
...
├─ android.animation.ObjectAnimator instance
│    Leaking: UNKNOWN
│    mListeners = null
│    mPropertyName = null
│    mProperty.mName = alpha
│    mProperty.mType = java.lang.Float
│    mInitialized = true
│    mStarted = true
│    mRunning = true
│    mAnimationEndRequested = false
│    mDuration = 100
│    mStartDelay = 0
│    mRepeatCount = INFINITE (-1)
│    mRepeatMode = REVERSE (2)
│    ↓ ObjectAnimator.mTarget
│                     ~~~~~~~
╰→ android.widget.Button instance
     Leaking: YES (View.mContext references a destroyed activity)
```

To learn more, see this AOSP issue: [ObjectAnimator.mTarget weak ref creates memory leaks on infinite animators](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/212993949).

### Leak detection in tests

Previous releases of `leakcanary-android-instrumentation` introduced a `FailTestOnLeakRunListener` which could run leak detection after each UI tests. Unfortunately `FailTestOnLeakRunListener` relied on a hack around `androidx.test` internals to report failures. The internals keep changing with every `androidx.test` release and breaking `FailTestOnLeakRunListener` 😭.

`FailTestOnLeakRunListener` is now deprecated (👋) and replaced by the `DetectLeaksAfterTestSuccess` test rule, which you can add to your test like any normal test rule.

Additionally, you can call `LeakAssertions.assertNoLeak()` from anywhere in your instrumentation tests. You can also annotate tests with `@SkipLeakDetection` (for that to work you'll also need to set up the `TestDescriptionHolder` test rule).

```kotlin
class CartTest {
  @get:Rule
  val rules = RuleChain.outerRule(TestDescriptionHolder)
    .around(DetectLeaksAfterTestSuccess())
    .around(ActivityScenarioRule(CartActivity::class.java))

  @Test
  fun addItemToCart() {
    // ...
  }

  @SkipLeakDetection("See #1234")
  @Test
  fun removeItemFromCart() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Android 12

Hopefully this time we fixed everything that Android 12 broke: missing `exported:true` tags, missing pending intent flags, and `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` crashes. If not, let us know! Can't wait for Android 13 to break everything again 🤬.

### WorkManager

Running an Android Service without crashing (`ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException`...) is becoming harder with every release of Android, so I got rid of the LeakCanary heap analyzer service! Instead, LeakCanary leverages WorkManager if you already have it as a dependency. If you don't use WorkManager, then LeakCanary will fall back to using a simple thread.

Note: I recommend using at least [WorkManager 2.7.0](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work#2.7.0) as it adds the `WorkRequest.Builder.setExpedited()` API which LeakCanarty leverages if available.

### Multi process

Switching to WorkManager also impacts the LeakCanary multi process approach, which now leverages WorkManager remote jobs. Blog on how I got this working: [WorkManager multi-process for libraries](https://py.hashnode.dev/workmanager-multi-process-for-libraries).

Multi process is harder to get right so you should only use this if LeakCanary frequently runs out of memory while performing the heap analysis. Here are the updated set up steps:

1) Add the `leakcanary-android-process` dependency and **keep the `leakcanary-android` dependency**.

```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.8'
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-process:2.8'
}
```

2) Skip the initialization code in the `Application` class

```kotlin
class ExampleApplication : Application() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    if (LeakCanaryProcess.isInAnalyzerProcess(this)) {
      return
    }
    super.onCreate()
    // normal init goes here, skipped in :leakcanary process.
  }
}
```

That's it! Note that event listeners (see below) related to the analysis will fire in the remote process.

### AndroidX App Startup

LeakCanary now optionally supports the [AndroidX App Startup library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/app-startup). All you need to do is replace the `leakcanary-android` dependency with `leakcanary-android-startup`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  // Remove the normal leakcanary-android dependency
  // debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.8'
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-startup:2.8'
}
```

Note 1: `leakcanary-android` adds the code for automatic installl to `leakcanary-android-core`. If you're calling `AppWatcher.manualInstall()`, you can depend directly on `leakcanary-android-core` instead of `leakcanary-android`, and you won't need the disable any automatic install.

Note 2: the same principle applies to `leakcanary-object-watcher-android`: it depends on `leakcanary-object-watcher-android-core` and adds automatic install, while `leakcanary-object-watcher-android-startup` leverages the App Startup library. Same for `plumber-android`, `plumber-android-core` and  `plumber-android-startup`.

### Event listeners

`LeakCanary.Config` has a new `eventListeners` field allowing you to react to LeakCanary's lifecycle. If you want to customize this, you most likely should be keeping the default list of listeners and add or remove from it.

For example, if you want to disable the LeakCanary toast:

```kotlin
LeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.run {
  copy(
    eventListeners = eventListeners.filter {
      it !is ToastEventListener
    }
  )
}
```

If you want to upload heap analysis results:

```kotlin
LeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.run {
  copy(
    eventListeners = eventListeners + EventListener { event ->
      if (event is HeapAnalysisSucceeded) {
        // Upload event.heapAnalysis
      }
    }
  )
}
```

Note: `Leakcanary.Config.onHeapAnalyzedListener` still works but is now deprecated.

Feedback welcome on this new API!

### Finer grained root view watching

In version 2.6, LeakCanary added detection of root views retained after  `View.onDetachedFromWindow()`. This helps find more leaks, but unfortunately some Android widgets keep a detached root view around to reattach it later (e.g. spinner). App developers also sometimes do the same with dialogs, keeping a single instance around and calling `show()` and `hide()` as needed. As a result, LeakCanary would report leaks that were actually not leaks.

In version 2.7, the default behavior changed: LeakCanary will continue to detect leaks of toasts, but will ignore root views created by a PopupWindow (which is what Android widgets use). It will also ignore root views created by a dialog by default, and you can turn this back on by setting the `leak_canary_watcher_watch_dismissed_dialogs` resource boolean to true:


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
  <bool name="leak_canary_watcher_watch_dismissed_dialogs">true</bool>
</resources>
```

This is implemented using a new Square library: [Curtains](https://github.com/square/curtains).

### Targeting Android 12

We fixed two issues for apps that want to target Android 12:

* [#2074](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/2074) Activities that use intent filters must declare the `android:exported` attribute.
* [#2079](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2079) PendingIntent requires the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag.

### Bug fixes and improvements 🐛🔨

This Christmas Release includes several external contributions and a bunch of cool new features! 🎁🎁

###  Detecting root views retained after `View.onDetachedFromWindow()`

On Android, every displayed view hierarchy is attached to a window, whether it be the view hierarchy of an activity, a dialog, a toast or [a chat head](http://www.piwai.info/chatheads-basics). After a view hierarchy is detached from its window, it should be garbage collected.

LeakCanary already detects leaks of activity view hierarchies because retained detached views reference their activity context and LeakCanary detects activities retained after `Activity.onDestroy()`. In this new release, LeakCanary will now detect the leak of a dialog view hierarchy as soon as that dialog is dismissed, or any other view that is passed to [WindowManager.removeView()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewManager#removeView(android.view.View)).

###  Detecting services retained after `Service.onDestroy()`

After an Android [service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service) is destroyed, it should be garbage collected. Unfortunately, the Android SDK does not provide any generic API to observe the service lifecycle. We worked around that using reflection on greylist APIs (details in [#2014](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/2014)). Let's hope this motivates the Android team to [build the APIs developers need](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1342029560116891648).

### Configuring retained object detection

With the detection of 2 new types of retained objects, we're also adding APIs to configure which _watchers_ should be installed as well as adding filtering capabilities.

First, disable the automatic install:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
  <bool name="leak_canary_watcher_auto_install">false</bool>
</resources>
```

Then you can install LeakCanary manually. LeakCanary 2.6 comes with 4 watchers installed by default: `ActivityWatcher`, `FragmentAndViewModelWatcher`, `RootViewWatcher`, `ServiceWatcher`. Here's an example to get all the default watchers except `ServiceWatcher`:

```kotlin
class DebugExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    val watchersToInstall = AppWatcher.appDefaultWatchers(application)
      .filter { it !is ServiceWatcher }

    AppWatcher.manualInstall(
      application = application,
      watchersToInstall = watchersToInstall
    )
  }
}
```

LeakCanary introduces a new functional (SAM) interface implemented by `ObjectWatcher`: `ReachabilityWatcher`, with a `ReachabilityWatcher.expectWeaklyReachable()` method that replaces the now deprecated `ObjectWatcher.watch()` method. You can create the default watcher instances with a custom `ReachabilityWatcher` that delegates to `AppWatcher.objectWatcher` but filters out specific instances (e.g. `BadSdkLeakingFragment`):

```kotlin
class DebugExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    val delegate = ReachabilityWatcher { watchedObject, description ->
      if (watchedObject !is BadSdkLeakingFragment) {
        AppWatcher.objectWatcher.expectWeaklyReachable(watchedObject, description)
      }
    }

    val watchersToInstall = AppWatcher.appDefaultWatchers(application, delegate)

    AppWatcher.manualInstall(
      application = application,
      watchersToInstall = watchersToInstall
    )
  }
}
```

With these new configuration options, `AppWatcher.config` is now deprecated and a no-op.

### Dumping the heap on screen off

The default threshold to dump the heap is **5 retained objects** when the app is **visible**, and **1 retained object** when the app is **not visible**. Up until now, visible meant "the app has at least one activity in **started** state". In LeakCanary 2.6, the app will now be considered **not visible** if the device screen is **off**, lowering the threshold to trigger heap dumps when you turn off the device screen.

### LeakCanary for releases

LeakCanary 2.6 introduces a new artifact: `leakcanary-android-release`. This artifact exposes APIs to run a heap analysis in release builds, in production.

!!! danger
    Everything about this is experimental. Running a heap analysis in production is not a very common thing to do, and we're still learning and experimenting with this. Also, both the artifact name and the APIs may change.

```groovy
dependencies {
  // debugImplementation because LeakCanary should only run in debug builds.
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.6'

  // NEW: LeakCanary for releases!
  releaseImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-release:2.6'
  // Optional: detect retained objects. This helps but is not required.
  releaseImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-object-watcher-android:2.6'
}
```

Here's a code example that runs a heap analysis when the screen is turned off or the app enters background, checking first if a [Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config) flag is turned on, and uploading the result to Bugsnag:


```kotlin
class ReleaseExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {

  // Cancels heap analysis if "heap_analysis_flag" is false.
  private val flagInterceptor by lazy {
    object : HeapAnalysisInterceptor {

      val remoteConfig: FirebaseRemoteConfig = TODO()

      override fun intercept(chain: Chain): HeapAnalysisJob.Result {
        if (remoteConfig.getBoolean("heap_analysis_flag")) {
          chain.job.cancel("heap_analysis_flag false")
        }
        return chain.proceed()
      }
    }
  }

  private val analysisClient by lazy {
    HeapAnalysisClient(
      // Use private app storage. cacheDir is never backed up which is important.
      heapDumpDirectoryProvider = { cacheDir },
      // stripHeapDump: remove all user data from hprof before analysis.
      config = HeapAnalysisConfig(stripHeapDump = true),
      // Default interceptors may cancel analysis for several other reasons.
      interceptors = listOf(flagInterceptor) + HeapAnalysisClient.defaultInterceptors(this)
    )
  }

  private val analysisExecutor by lazy {
    Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor {
      thread(start = false, name = "Heap analysis executor") {
        android.os.Process.setThreadPriority(THREAD_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND)
        it.run()
      }
    }
  }

  private val analysisCallback: (Result) -> Unit by lazy {
    val uploader = BugsnagHeapAnalysisUploader(this@ReleaseExampleApplication)
    { result ->
      if (result is Done) {
        uploader.upload(result.analysis)
	  }
    }
  }

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    // Delete any remaining heap dump (if we crashed)
    analysisExecutor.execute {
      analysisClient.deleteHeapDumpFiles()
    }

    // Starts heap analysis on background importance
    BackgroundTrigger(
      application = this,
      analysisClient = analysisClient,
      analysisExecutor = analysisExecutor,
      analysisCallback = analysisCallback
    ).start()

    // Starts heap analysis when screen off
    ScreenOffTrigger(
      application = this,
      analysisClient = analysisClient,
      analysisExecutor = analysisExecutor,
      analysisCallback = analysisCallback
    ).start()
  }

  /**
   * Call this to trigger heap analysis manually, e.g. from
   * a help button.
   *
   * This method returns a `HeapAnalysisJob` on which you can
   * call `HeapAnalysisJob.cancel()` at any time.
   */
  fun triggerHeapAnalysisNow(): HeapAnalysisJob {
    val job = analysisClient.newJob()
    analysisExecutor.execute {
      val result = job.execute()
      analysisCallback(result)
    }
    return job
  }
}
```

The Bugsnag uploader:

```kotlin
class BugsnagHeapAnalysisUploader(applicationContext: Application) {

  private val bugsnagClient: Client

  init {
    bugsnagClient = Client(
      applicationContext,
      BUGSNAG_API_KEY,
      DO_NOT_ENABLE_EXCEPTION_HANDLER
    )
    bugsnagClient.setSendThreads(false)
  }

  fun upload(heapAnalysis: HeapAnalysis) {
    when (heapAnalysis) {
      is HeapAnalysisSuccess -> {
        val exception = HeapAnalysisReport()
        bugsnagClient.notify(exception) { report ->
          val metaData = report.error.metaData
          metaData.addToTab("Heap Analysis", "result", heapAnalysis.toString())
        }
      }
      is HeapAnalysisFailure -> {
        // Please file any reported failure to
        // https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues
        bugsnagClient.notify(heapAnalysis.exception)
      }
    }
  }

  // Exception with fake unique stacktrace to send all reports to the same error entry.
  class HeapAnalysisReport : Exception("Check the HEAP ANALYSIS tab") {
    override fun fillInStackTrace(): Throwable {
      stackTrace = arrayOf(
        StackTraceElement(
          "HeapAnalysisReport",
          "analyzeHeap",
          "HeapAnalysisReport.kt",

### More leak fixes in Plumber

We added 3 new automatic fixes for known AOSP leaks in `plumber-android` (details: [#1993](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1993)). As a reminder, `plumber-android` is automatically included when you add `leakcanary-android`, and you can add it manually for build types that don't include LeakCanary:

```gradle
dependencies {
  // leakcanary-android adds plumber-android to debug builds
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.6'

  // This adds plumber-android to all build types
  implementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:plumber-android:2.6'
}
```

### Bug fixes and improvements 🐛🔨

* [#1948](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1948) Leakcanary is now compiled against Kotlin 1.4 (while staying 1.3 compatible) to support [Functional (SAM) interfaces](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/fun-interfaces.html).
* [#1956](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1956) The retained object size is displayed as a human readable output (KB, MB, ...).
* [#1976](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1976) Improved default object inspectors and leak finders for `View` and `Context`.
* [#1972](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1972) Fields are printed with the parent class name that holds the field in leak traces.
* [#1981](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1981) Fixed StrictMode policy violation (main thread read from disk).
* [#1977](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1977) Report objects that are not strongly reachable.
* [#2018](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/2018) & [#2019](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/2019) Fixed crashes in LeakCanary UI (discovered by Monkey tests).
* [#2015](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2015) Fixed crash on Android < 16.
* [#2023](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2023) Fixed crash in plugin projects.

### Heap analysis is twice as fast 🐤💨

No one asked, so we delivered! We rewrote several core components in Shark (LeakCanary's heap analyzer) to dramatically reduce IO reads and allocations while keeping memory constant. More details on Twitter: [thread by @ArtemChubaryan](https://twitter.com/ArtemChubaryan/status/1311078061895553030) and [thread by @Piwai](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1311085280753926144).

### Compute retained size within the leak trace

Previously, LeakCanary computed the retained size for the leaking object (the last object in the leak trace). However, the bad reference causing objects to leak is often higher up in the leak trace and everything that it holds onto is actually leaking. So LeakCanary now computes the retained size for [all the objects in the leaktrace that have a LEAKING or UNKNOWN status](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1880):

```
┬───
│ GC Root: System class
│
├─ com.example.MySingleton class
│    Leaking: NO (a class is never leaking)
│    ↓ static MySingleton.leakedView
│                         ~~~~~~~~~~
├─ android.widget.TextView instance
│    Leaking: YES (View.mContext references a destroyed activity)
│    Retaining 46326 bytes in 942 objects
│    ↓ TextView.mContext
╰→ com.example.MainActivity instance
​     Leaking: YES (Activity#mDestroyed is true)
​     Retaining 1432 bytes in 36 objects
```

### Disable LeakCanary from the UI

New toggle to disable [heap dumping](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1886), which can be useful for QA, or when doing a product demo. LeakCanary will still show a notification when an object is retained.

![disable heap dumping](images/disable_dumping.png)

### Deobfuscating hprof files

The [Shark CLI](shark.md#shark-cli) can now [deobfuscate heap dumps](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1698):

```
brew install leakcanary-shark

shark-cli --hprof heapdump.hprof -m mapping.txt deobfuscate-hprof
```

### Bug fixes and improvements 🐛🔨

* Heap analysis text results now [wrap to a max width](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1811) when sharing them from the LeakCanary activity or printing to logcat. This will make it harder to miss details that are lost at the end of long lines of text.
* The `leak_canary_watcher_auto_install`, `leak_canary_allow_in_non_debuggable_build` and `leak_canary_plumber_auto_install` resource booleans were [meant to be public](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1863).
* We sprinkled a few `@JvmStatic` to [help Java consummers](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1870).
* Fixed [crash when no browser installed](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1893).
* Use distinct [group for LeakCanary notifications](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1845).
* The heap analysis result now includes the [heap dump duration](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1931) because it looks like Android 11 heap dumps are [sometimes super slow](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/168634429). We also added more [perf related metrics](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1929).
* [Disable logging](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1910) when AppWatcher runs in release builds.
* Highlight library leak patterns [directly within the leak traces](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1916).
* Improved inspections for [Context, View](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1912) and [ContextImpl](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1884).

### `plumber-android` is a new artifact that fixes known Android leaks 🚽🔧

LeakCanary reports all leaks, including leaks caused by a known bug in 3rd party code that you do not have control over (reported as [Library leaks](fundamentals-how-leakcanary-works.md#4-categorizing-leaks)). That can be annoying! LeakCanary now ships with a new dependency, `plumber-android`, which performs hacks at runtime to fix some of these known leaks. This releases has fixes for **11 known leaks**, but this is just the beginning. Contributions welcome! 🙏

Note that since the `leakcanary-android` dependency is usually added as a `debugImplementation` dependency, the `plumber-android` is transitively added only in debug builds, so it will not fix leaks in your release builds. You can add the dependency directly as `implementation` to get these fixes in release builds as well:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:plumber-android:2.4'
}
```

!!! warning
    While several of these fixes already ship in release builds of Square apps, this is the first official release of `plumber-android`, so you should consider it **experimental**.

### Analyzing leaks from the CLI is easier than ever 🍺

The [Shark CLI](shark.md#shark-cli) can now be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install leakcanary-shark
```

You can then look for leaks in apps on any connected device, for example:

```
$ shark-cli --device emulator-5554 --process com.example.app.debug analyze
```

### Support for Android Test Orchestrator 🎼

If you set up LeakCanary to report test failures when detecting leaks in [instrumentation tests](recipes.md#running-leakcanary-in-instrumentation-tests), it [now works](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1046) with Android Test Orchestrator as well. No change required, LeakCanary will automatically detect thatAndroid Test Orchestrator is running and hook into it.

### No more `master` branch

The branch name `master` comes from the *master / slave* terminology. We renamed the default branch to `main`, a small step towards making the LeakCanary community a safer space. Here's a good [thread on this topic](https://twitter.com/mislav/status/1270388510684598272).

### Bug fixes and improvements 🐛🔨

* URLs in *Library Leak* descriptions are [now clickable](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1844)
* Fixed [ordering issues](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1832) causing improper config with manual setup. A related change is that `AppWatcher.Config.enabled` is now deprecated.
* Fixed possible [OutOfMemoryError failure](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1798) when computing retained size: we were loading to memory large arrays from the heap dump just to get their size.

For more details, see the [2.4 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/18) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.3...v2.4).

## Version 2.3 (2020-04-08)

This is a minor release on the feature front, but a large release on the documentation front!

### LeakCanary will now crash in release builds

Despite the documentation insisting on using `debugImplementation`, we've seen apps [ship LeakCanary](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1245524534712602624) in **release builds**. Mistakes happen, so we've made that mistake [harder to miss](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1804) by making LeakCanary **crash when included in release builds**.

Learn More: [LeakCanary in release builds](recipes.md#leakcanary-in-release-builds).

### Doc site 🛀💥

The doc site content has changed quite a bit! We applied advice from [Google's tech writing guide](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/). If you've been confused by *Library Leaks* before, check out see the new [Categorizing leaks](fundamentals-how-leakcanary-works.md#4-categorizing-leaks) section. Take a look around, let us know what you think.

### Bug fixes and improvements 😉

* The new [deobfuscation Gradle plugin](recipes.md#using-leakcanary-with-obfuscated-apps) wasn't working [with Gradle 3.6](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1761), this is now fixed. Also removed the requirement for the plugin to be [applied after AGP](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1816).
* Fixed 2 crashes ([#1768](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1768) & [#1769](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1769)) in the LeakCanary UI found by a sneaky monkey runner 🙈.
* The LeakCanary UI updates [immediately](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1742) when a heap analysis is added or deleted.
* Fixed a crash when [updating from LeakCanary 2.0](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1800).
* The *About* section of the LeakCanary now surfaces whether heap dumping is [currently enabled](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1803).
* Fixed process [not exiting](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1711) in SharkCLI on Windows.
* Improved [error message](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1823) when obfuscation mappings appear to be missing.

For more details, see the [2.3 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/17) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.2...v2.3).

## Version 2.2 (2020-02-05)

We've got some good stuff for the first release of the decade!

### ViewModel leak detection

[Android ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) are really cool! Their lifecycle is much nicer than fragments or activities, but sometimes mistakes happen. LeakCanary will now automatically detect ViewModel leaks and report any ViewModel instance retained after its `onCleared()` method was called.

### Android TV

![tv ui](images/android-tv-leaks.png)

LeakCanary is finally coming to big screens near you! Best part - no additional setup is required, just enable it like you would for a [mobile device](getting_started.md). Now whenever there's a leak - you will see a helpful Toast appear with all the details. Make sure to check out our new [Android TV](recipes.md#android-tv) section and chill!

### Java-friendly Config builders

[It was brought to our attention](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1714) that configuring `LeakCanary` and `AppWatcher` was a miserable experience from Java code. Well, not anymore!

Now you can use `LeakCanary.Config.Builder` and `AppWatcher.Config.Builder` to have idiomatic Java when updating the configurations. For example:

```
LeakCanary.Config config = LeakCanary.getConfig().newBuilder()
  .retainedVisibleThreshold(3)
  .computeRetainedHeapSize(false)
  .build();
LeakCanary.setConfig(config);
```

If you notice any other problems when using LeakCanary from Java, please [file an issue](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=3-feature.md&title=)! We take Java-interop seriously and will be happy to improve LeakCanary's API!

For more details, see the [2.2 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/16) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.1...v2.2).

## Version 2.1 (2019-12-31)

### A Gradle plugin for obfuscated apps

It's fairly common for teams to have a QA build that is tested before making the release build. Usually that build will be obfuscated (via Proguard or R8), but also add LeakCanary to detect leaks during QA. This leads to obfuscated leak traces, which are hard to understand 🤯. Check out our new [Gradle deobfuscation plugin](recipes.md#using-leakcanary-with-obfuscated-apps) and rejoice!

### UI <strike>twix</strike> tweaks

In 2.0 we changed the LeakCanary UI and UX, and built a foundation on which 2.1 extends.

![ui](images/screenshot-2.0.png)

* Since 2.0, Leaks are grouped by their distinct signature. In 2.1 there's a `New` tag that will show until you open up a leak. There's also a `Library Leak` tag for leaks that are known to be caused by a bug in the Android Framework or Google libraries, and the library leak description now shows up in the UI.
* The type of the Java objects (class, instance, array) is now displayed in the LeakTrace, e.g. see `FontsContract class` and `ExampleApplication instance` above.
* The type of the GC root now shows up at the root of the leak trace. Makes sense!
* The leak result notification has an importance now set to MAX so that it'll show up right in your face. If you turn it off, the canary will haunt you in your dreams 🐤👻. To save your sanity and your device battery, automatic heap dumps now won't happen more often than once per minute.
* The resource id name for `View` instances is now displayed in the leak trace. You shouldn't look at the [implementation](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1663).

```
├─ android.widget.TextView instance
│    View.mID = R.id.helper_text
```

### Documentation goodies

* The [Fundamentals](fundamentals.md) page was entirely rewritten, split into 3 pages and moved to its own tab. Please read it and provide feedback!
* At Square, we have been uploading leaks to Bugsnag for 3 years now, so that no leak ever gets missed. Follow [this recipe](recipes.md#uploading-to-bugsnag)!
* Did you know you can [run LeakCanary in a JVM](recipes.md#detecting-leaks-in-jvm-applications)?

### API <strike>breaking</strike> bettering changes

* The APIs of the `Leak` and `LeakTrace` classes have significantly changed, e.g. all `LeakTrace` instances with an identical signature are grouped under the same Leak object. Despite these breaking changes, this release version is a minor update. Oh noes, what about semantic versioning 😱? Ask Don Quixote.
* You can now customize the way LeakCanary finds the leaking objects in the heap dump. For example, here's the configuration SharkCli uses to find leaks in heap dumps of apps that don't even have the LeakCanary dependency:

```kotlin
LeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.copy(
    leakingObjectFinder = FilteringLeakingObjectFinder(
        AndroidObjectInspectors.appLeakingObjectFilters
    )
)
```

* LeakCanary automatically disables itself in tests by detecting that the `org.junit.Test` is in the classpath. Unfortunately, some apps ship Junit in their app debug classpath (e.g. when using OkHttp MockWebServer). You can now customize which class is used to detect tests:

```xml
<resources>
  <string name="leak_canary_test_class_name">assertk.Assert</string>
</resources>
```

### Interactive CLI

[Shark CLI](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/releases/download/v2.1/shark-cli-2.1.zip) was rewritten on top of [Clikt](https://github.com/ajalt/clikt):

```bash
$ shark-cli
Usage: shark-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

                 ^`.                 .=""=.

Options:
  -p, --process NAME              Full or partial name of a process, e.g.
                                  "example" would match "com.example.app"
  -d, --device ID                 device/emulator id
  -m, --obfuscation-mapping PATH  path to obfuscation mapping file
  --verbose / --no-verbose        provide additional details as to what
                                  shark-cli is doing
  -h, --hprof FILE                path to a .hprof file
  --help                          Show this message and exit

Commands:
  interactive   Explore a heap dump.

  strip-hprof   Replace all primitive arrays from the provided heap dump with
                arrays of zeroes and generate a new "-stripped.hprof" file.
```

There's a new `interactive` command which enables exploring the heap dump from the command line:

```bash
$ shark-cli -h heapdump.hprof interactive
Enter command [help]:
help

Available commands:
  analyze                   Analyze the heap dump.
  class NAME@ID             Show class with a matching NAME and Object ID.

  help                      Show this message.
  exit                      Exit this interactive prompt.
```

We're currently exploring the idea of adding [support for SQL queries](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1211795647273160704), feedback welcome!

For more details, see the [2.1 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/15) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v2.0...v2.1).

## Version 2.0 (2019-11-27)

In the past 7 months, LeakCanary went through 3 alphas and 5 betas, encompassing 23 contributors over 493 commits, 35826 insertions and 10156 deletions.

### Should I upgrade?

**YES!** LeakCanary 2 is so much better, it might make you excited when you see a new memory leak. Follow the [upgrade guide](upgrading-to-leakcanary-2.0.md), you won't regret it!

### So, what's changed since 1.6.3?

**Everything.** The LeakCanary codebase went from **~6000** lines of Java to **~16000** lines of Kotlin, excluding comments & blanks.

!!! question "Isn't Kotlin supposed to drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate code?"
    Absolutely! And it did. But then, we wrote more code.
    LeakCanary used to depend on [HAHA](https://github.com/square/haha), a repackaging of [perflib](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/2f03004c181baf9d291a9bf992e1b444e83cd82d/perflib/), the heap dump parser used by Android Studio. Unfortunately perflib was slow and used too much memory, so LeakCanary now includes its own heap dump parser: [Shark](shark.md). The extra code comes from Shark, but also from having a lot more automated tests, and an improved UI layer.

One major difference: when the app is in foreground, LeakCanary 2 will not trigger on every retained instance. Instead it will wait until the app goes in background or to reach a threashold of 5 retained instances in foreground. The analysis will then find all the leaks at once, and group identical leaks in the results UI. Please read the [Fundamentals](fundamentals.md) section to learn more!

### Random facts

* You can customize the Leaks launcher icon and label: [learn more here](recipes.md#icon-and-label).
* If you ` press on your main activity launcher icon, you should see a LeakCanary dynamic shortcut. You can then long press that to drop it on your home screen, and the launcher shows that it's the leaks launcher for your app.
* Out of the box, LeakCanary tracks all fragments flavors: AOSP, Support Library and Android X.
* From within the leak screen, you can share a leak to stack overflow. You can also share a heap dump, or import and analyze a heap dump from another device.
* You can run LeakCanary from your computer command line, on any debuggable app even if that app doesn't have LeakCanary: [learn more here](shark.md##shark-cli).
* The new documentation is fully searchable and includes the API documentation. Try the search bar ⤴.
* A large 160Mb heap dump uses 2Gb memory when opening it in Android Studio, but only 40Mb with Shark.

### Changes since 2.0 Beta 5

## Version 2.0 Beta 1 (2019-07-30)

* New standalone library! [Shark](shark.md) is the heap analyzer that powers LeakCanary 2, and it can run in any Java VM. It comes with a [CLI](shark.md#shark-cli): you can now run `shark-cli analyze-process com.example.myapp` from your computer.
* New Heap Explorer directly on device! Open a Heap Analysis in LeakCanary, tap the options menu and select "Heap Explorer". This is still experimental and not very user friendly, contributions welcome!
* **Large API rewrite** to improve usability. If you used the alpha with a customized configuration, there are breaking changes. Of note: LeakSentry became [AppWatcher](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-object-watcher-android/leakcanary/-app-watcher/), RefWatcher became [ObjectWatcher](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-object-watcher/leakcanary/-object-watcher/), AndroidExcludedRefs became [AndroidReferenceMatchers](/leakcanary/api/shark-android/shark/-android-reference-matchers/), AnalysisResultListener became [OnHeapAnalyzedListener](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-android-core/leakcanary/-on-heap-analyzed-listener/), AndroidLeakTraceInspectors became [AndroidObjectInspectors](/leakcanary/api/shark-android/shark/-android-object-inspectors/).
* The entire API surface is now documented and the documentation is available on this website: see the **LeakCanary API** tab at the top.
* Removed the **dependency on Android X**. No more configuration issues! [#1462](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1462)
* Added **Proguard rules** for LeakCanary and ObjectWatcher. [#1500](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1500)
* Display LeakCanary version in the About screen. [#1448](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1448)
* Bug fixes, new reference matchers and object inspectors

## Version 2.0 Alpha 3 (2019-07-04)

* [#1401](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1401) LeakCanary can now import all hprof files created from prior LeakCanary versions.
* [#1414](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1414) New API: `RefWatcher.retainedInstances` which returns the instances that are currently considered retained.
* [#1419](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1419) New APIs: `LeakCanary.Config.maxStoredHeapDumps` (default 7) and `LeakCanary.Config.requestWriteExternalStoragePermission` (default false). LeakCanary won't ask for the external storage permission anymore by default.
* [#1338](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1338) API change: `LeakCanary.Config.exclusionsFactory` replaced with `LeakCanary.Config.knownReferences` (simpler use), `LeakCanary.Config.leakInspectors` and `LeakCanary.Config.labelers` merged into `LeakCanary.Config.leakTraceInspectors` which provides access to the entire leak trace as well as a new graph oriented API that replaces the low level hprof parser API.
* [#1382](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1382) LeakCanary now disables automatic heap dumping when running in AndroidX UI tests.
* [#1424](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1424) API rename: `RefWatcher.hasRetainedReferences` => `RefWatcher.hasRetainedInstances`, `RefWatcher.retainedReferenceCount` => `RefWatcher.retainedInstanceCount`, `RefWatcher.hasWatchedReferences` => `RefWatcher.hasWatchedInstances`, `RefWatcher.removeKeysRetainedBeforeHeapDump` => `RefWatcher.removeInstancesRetainedBeforeHeapDump`, `RefWatcher.clearWatchedReferences` => `RefWatcher.clearWatchedInstances`.

### Public API changes

* Subclasses of `AbstractAnalysisResultService` should now override `onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull AnalyzedHeap analyzedHeap)` instead of `onHeapAnalyzed(@NonNull HeapDump heapDump, @NonNull AnalysisResult result)`

For more details, see the [1.6.2 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/4) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2).

## Version 1.6.1 (2018-06-21)

* [#727](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/727) Improved leak analysis: LeakCanary now identifies and highlights the potential causes of the leak.
* [#1011](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1011) We noticed that computing the retained heap size could take a long time, so it's now optional and off by default.
* [#633](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/633) Support for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests ([see the wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Customizing-LeakCanary#running-leakcanary-in-instrumentation-tests)).
* [#985](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/985) Ability to convert leak traces into stack traces for easy remote reporting ([see the wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Customizing-LeakCanary#uploading-to-a-server)).
* [#983](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/983) Support for watching destroyed Fragments.
* [#846](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/846) LeakCanary now uses foreground services and displays a notification when the analysis is in progress. This also fixes crashes when analyzing in background on O+.
* The LeakCanary icon (to start to DisplayLeakActivity) is now hidden by default, and only enabled after the first leak is found.
* [#775](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/775) Fixed crash when sharing heap dumps on O+ and added a dependency to the support-core-utils library.
* [#930](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/930) DisplayLeakActivity has a responsive icon.
* [#685](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/685) Stopped doing IO on main thread in DisplayLeakActivity (fixes StrictMode errors).
* [#999](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/999) Updated HAHA to 2.0.4, which uses Trove4j as an external dependency (from jcenter) instead of rebundling it. This is to clarify licences (Apache v2 vs LGPL 2.1).
* Several bug and crash fixes.

 for the code contributions!

Note: we made a 1.6 release but quickly followed up with 1.6.1 due to [#1058](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1058).

### Public API changes

* The installed ref watcher singleton is now available via `LeakCanary.installedRefWatcher()`
* `AnalysisResult.leakTraceAsFakeException()` returns an exception that can be used to report and group leak traces to a tool like Bugsnag or Crashlytics.
* New `InstrumentationLeakDetector` and `FailTestOnLeakRunListener` APIs for detecting leaks in instrumentation tests.
* New `Reachability.Inspector` and `RefWatcherBuilder.stethoscopeClasses()` API to establish reachability and help identify leak causes.
* Watching activities can be disabled with `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchActivities(false)`, watching fragments can be disabled with `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder.watchFragments(false)`
* `LeakCanary.setDisplayLeakActivityDirectoryProvider()` is deprecated and replaced with `LeakCanary.setLeakDirectoryProvider()`
* New `RefWatcherBuilder.computeRetainedHeapSize()` API to enable the computing of the retained heap size (off by default).

For more details, see the [1.6.1 Milestone](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/milestone/3) and the [full diff](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/compare/v1.5.4...v1.6.1).

## Version 1.5 *(2016-09-28)*

* New excluded leaks
* Added `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess()` to the no-op jar
* Fixed several file access issues:
    * No more cleanup on startup, we rotate the heap dump files on every new heap dump.
    * LeakCanary now falls back to the app directory until it can write to the external storage.
* Leak notifications now each use a distinct notification instead of erasing each other.
* If LeakCanary can't perform a heap dump for any reason (e.g. analysis in progress, debugger attached), it retries later with an exponential backoff.
* Added confirmation dialog when user deletes all leaks.
* Replace the two LeakCanary configuration methods with a builder that provides more flexibility, see `LeakCanary.refWatcher()`.

* New `HeapAnalyzer.findTrackedReferences()` method for headless analysis when you have no context on what leaked.
* Added `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess()` to the no-op jar
* Added `LeakCanary.refWatcher()` which returns an `AndroidRefWatcherBuilder` that extends `RefWatcherBuilder` and lets you fully customize the `RefWatcher` instance.
* Removed `LeakCanary.install(Application, Class)` and `LeakCanary.androidWatcher(Context, HeapDump.Listener, ExcludedRefs)`.
* Removed `R.integer.leak_canary_max_stored_leaks` and `R.integer.leak_canary_watch_delay_millis`, those can now be set via `LeakCanary.refWatcher()`.
* Updated the `LeakDirectoryProvider` API to centralize all file related responsibilities.
* `RefWatcher` is now constructed with a `WatchExecutor` which executes a `Retryable`, instead of an `Executor` that executes a `Runnable`.
* `HeapDumper.NO_DUMP` was renamed `HeapDumper.RETRY_LATER`

* Switched to [HAHA 2.0.2](https://github.com/square/haha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-202-2015-07-20) with uses Perflib instead of MAT under the hood [#219](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/219). This fixes crashes and improves speed a lot.
* We can now parse Android M heap dumps [#267](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/267), although there are still memory issues (see [#223](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/223)).
* Excluded leaks are now reported as well and available in the display leak activity.
* Added ProGuard configuration for [#132](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/132).
* Many new ignored Android SDK leaks.
* Added excluded leaks to text report [#119](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/119).
* Added LeakCanary SHA to text report [#120](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/120).

* Add retained size to leak reports [#162](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/162).

### Public API changes

* AnalysisResult.failure is now a `Throwable` instead of an `Exception`. Main goal is to catch and correctly report OOMs while parsing.
* Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries.
* Renamed `ExcludedRefs` fields.
* Each `ExcludedRef` entry can now be ignored entirely or "kept only if no other path".
* Added support for ignoring all fields (static and non static) for a given class.

## Version 1.3.1 *(2015-05-16)*

* Heap dumps and analysis results are now saved on the sd card: [#21](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/21).
* `ExcludedRef` and `AndroidExcludedRefs` are customizable: [#12](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/12) [#73](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/73).
* 7 new ignored Android SDK leaks: [#1](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1) [#4](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/4) [#32](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/32) [#89](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/89) [#82](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/82) [#97](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/97).
* Fixed 3 crashes in LeakCanary: [#37](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/37) [#46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46) [#66](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/66).
* Fixed StrictMode thread policy violations: [#15](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/15).
* Updated `minSdkVersion` from `9` to `8`: [#57](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/57).
* Added LeakCanary version name to `LeakCanary.leakInfo()`: [#49](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49).
* `leakcanary-android-no-op` is lighter, it does not depend on `leakcanary-watcher` anymore, only 2 classes now: [#74](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/74).
* Adding field state details to the text leak trace.
* A Toast is displayed while the heap dump is in progress to warn that the UI will freeze: [#20](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/49). You can customize the toast by providing your own layout named `__leak_canary_heap_dump_toast.xml` (e.g. you could make it an empty layout).
* If the analysis fails, the result and heap dump are kept so that it can be reported to LeakCanary: [#102](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/102).
* Update to HAHA 1.3 to fix a 2 crashes [#3](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/3) [46](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/46)

### Public API changes

* When upgrading from 1.3 to 1.3.1, previously saved heap dumps will not be readable any more, but they won't be removed from the app directory. You should probably uninstall your app.
* Added `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to `leakcanary-android` artifact.
* `LeakCanary.androidWatcher()` parameter types have changed (+ExcludedRefs).
* `LeakCanary.leakInfo()` parameter types have changed (+boolean)
* `ExcludedRef` is now serializable and immutable, instances can be created using `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` is available in `HeapDump`
* `AndroidExcludedRefs` is an enum, you can now pick the leaks you want to ignore in `AndroidExcludedRefs` by creating an `EnumSet` and calling `AndroidExcludedRefs.createBuilder()`.
* `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAppDefaults()` & `AndroidExcludedRefs.createAndroidDefaults()` return a `ExcludedRef.Builder`.
* `ExcludedRef` moved from `leakcanary-analyzer` to `leakcanary-watcher`

## Version 1.3 *(2015-05-08)*

Initial release.
